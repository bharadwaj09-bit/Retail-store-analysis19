Title: Global Mart Sales Analysis

Description
This project involves analyzing a retail dataset containing sales data from 2022 and 2023, sourced from Kaggle. 
The data has been processed and analyzed in a Jupyter notebook with SQL integration to derive meaningful insights.
Here's an overview of the steps involved:
Data Cleaning: Null values and unknown entries were removed, and column names were standardized to lowercase.
Derived Columns: New columns were created from existing data to facilitate deeper analysis.
SQL Analysis: Various SQL queries were executed to answer critical business questions.
Analysis:
Using SQL, I conducted an in-depth analysis to answer key business questions, including:
Identification of the top 10 revenue-generating products.
Analysis of the top 5 best-selling products by region.
Month-over-month sales growth comparison for 2022 and 2023.
Determination of the month with the highest sales per category.
Assessment of sub-category growth by percentage between 2022 and 2023.
Outputs
The analysis yields valuable insights that can inform marketing strategies and optimize inventory management.
